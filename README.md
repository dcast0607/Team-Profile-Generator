# Team Profile Generator

## Overview

The objective of this project is to give a manager the option to enter data about their team through a command line interface. Once the manager
has entered this data through the command line interface, we take this data and render an HTML document that contains code that depicts the information
that the manager has entered. 

To get this project to a working state, we introduced some automated testing, objects, fs npm package and heavily use inquire package to prompt the user to enter
the right employee data.
